SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

Hello! Today, we will explore some fundamental principles in software development that have tested to be invaluable for building efficient, maintainable, and strong software systems.
These principles are KISS, DRY, YAGNI, and others. Let's dive right in!

YAGNI - YOU AREN'T GONNA NEED IT
It reminds developers not to implement features or capabilities that are deemed unnecessary at the moment. We have to refactor and remove unused code and have to focus on building what is needed now and use version control of course.

DRY DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF promotes developers to extract common functionality into reusable components, functions, or modules. When we repeat code, we introduce a higher risk of conflicts and errors when changes need to be made. By adhering to the DRY principle, we reduce maintenance efforts and create a more maintainable and efficient codebase.

KISS Keep It Simple, Silly
KISS encourages developers to avoid unnecessary complexity in their code, design, and architecture. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug. By keeping things straightforward, we minimize the chances of introducing bugs and make the codebase more accessible to other team members.

Now, let's talk about the importance of Big Design Up Front.
Before diving into the implementation phase, take the time to plan thoroughly. I know it may feel like you're not making progress until you start coding, but having a well-thought-out plan can save you from starting from scratch later on. Involve others in the design process early to catch flaws and ensure an easier your development journey.

Avoid Early Optimization is another important principle. Don't optimize code before it's proven necessary. Apply the KISS and YAGNI principles to avoid unnecessary
optimization that may lead to increased development time and costs.

In conclusion, these software development principles play a crucial role in shaping how we design and build software. Embracing these principles leads to cleaner code, reduced complexity, and increased agility in software development projects.
Thank you for your attention!
