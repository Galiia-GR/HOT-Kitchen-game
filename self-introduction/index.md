Hi, thank you for your time!

My name is Galiia Gusamutdinova and I am a Junior Frontend Developer. I have Engineer Degree in Computer Science and Robotics, I have graduated from the Russian State Aviation Technical University in Ufa. Now I'm based in a beautiful city Astana, Kazakhstan.

You can ask me how and for what reason I came to RS School. This story began a long time ago when I was a child. My grandfather and I were passionate about computers and everything related to them and this was our common hobby. Then I went to the technical university and graduated from it. But unfortunately, it was not popular in my city as an industry. And us a result, I started working in a different field, namely purchase in medicine. I have a family and I had to wait for my children to grow up. My wish to become a developer has not faded and that is why I am here.

Recently I quit my job to fully devote my time to learning, I am actively studying JavaScript in the Rolling Scopes School. I did “Shelter”, “Plants” layouts, single page application “momentum” , “virtual-keyboard” “cssBayan”,  and I struggled with recursion in “minesweeper” application, it was quite hard. I am solving problems using algorithms on the codewars website.

I have already completed courses at the Udemy platform such as “JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert!” and “Build Responsive Websites with HTML and CSS” by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I am very passionate about web development, I love learning and I want to fully immerse into development, understanding architecture,  technologies to create more high-quality and productive applications as my goal is to become an experienced frontend developer.

I will be very happy and grateful if you become my mentor, I will follow you because your experience that you are going to share is very valuable.

Fun fact about me, I like sports, especially running, swimming, skiing, hiking. But my favourite is trail running. Running helps me stay active, positive and productive.

That was a short self-presentation, thanks for your attention!
